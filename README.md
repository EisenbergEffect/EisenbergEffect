### Hi, I'm Rob ðŸ‘‹

With 35 years of programming experience and 20 years as a professional software architect, I've built and shipped solutions across dozens of industries including e-commerce, manufacturing, HR, gaming, developer tools, CMS, medical, education, pro audio, web platform, and more.

I bring 16 years of progressive leadership experience through all levels, building and managing successful engineering teamsâ€”co-located, hybrid, and remoteâ€”focused on front-end, cloud, and full-stack.

My open-source contributions span 18 years, creating globally recognized projects used by tens of thousands of developers to ship experiences to over 1 billion customers worldwide. You may know me as the architect and technical advisor for Microsoft's FAST technology or as the original creator of Aurelia, Durandal, Caliburn.Micro, and Caliburn. I was also a technical lead early on for Angular 2 and an AngularJS and Angular Material team member, with my earliest open-source work on Castle Project and NHibernate.

Currently, I'm leading Blue Spire's initiatives in web standards while advising industry C-Suite and engineering leaders on technical strategy, software architecture, engineering culture, and open-source programs. My expertise extends to expert witnessing and specialized training for development teams in Web Standards, DDD, and Agile.
Currently I consult, teach, and mentor developers, mostly focused on Web Standards, Web Components, UI Architecture, and Engineering Culture.
